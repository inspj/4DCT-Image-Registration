# 4DCT-Image-Registration

DIR or deformable image registration is a technique of calculating a volume element correspondence between images. It is important for a doctor to be able to quantify pathology progression, and DIR can provide such an assessment. By developing a comprehensive method for intra-patient CT image registration, it is possible to improve the efficiency and quality of the diagnostic procedure. However, for patient safety, DIR spatial accuracy performance must be systematically and objectively assessed. The usage of landmark point-pairs technique for accuracy evaluation is one way to address this challenge. This method can be used to analyze registration in relation to the underlying anatomy depicted in medical imaging.

For the purposes of this project 4DCT scans were provided in inhale and exhale phase and 300 landmark features corresponding to both phases which were used for assessment of the best registration parameters.
